        <p id="mainInfo">Pasadena High School has been around for more than 50 years and never has it had a male volleyball team until 2017. In 2016  a group of friends and I set out to create a volleyball club and through hard work and fundraising we raised enough money to turn it into a team. Now in 11th grade I am currently playing on the varsity team as on outside hitter and I absolutely love it. I have developed many skills due to this sport and team. I have learned to stay focused and pick myself up after I make a mistake and always stay positive in bad situations. This sport has also helped me become less shy because I interact with new people all the time and have to perform in front of a medium to large audience under pressure
