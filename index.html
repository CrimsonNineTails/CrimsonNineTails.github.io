        <p id="mainInfo">My name is Anders Museth. I am currently enrolled at Pasadena High School, and I have developed an interest in computer science. This interest stems from my dad who works as a computer scientist at Weta Digital and SpaceX. I have also come to greatly enjoy math and science. This is due to the fact that I enjoy sitting down and slowly and meticulously work on solving a problem. My extracurricular passions include chess and volleyball. In my sophomore year helped start a volleyball club which has slowly become a sport at our school. I am currently on the Pasadena High School's first ever varsity volleyball team and am striving to become a better player. As for chess I am currently not in any clubs however in 8th grade I won first place while being undefeated at Sierra Madre Middle School</p>
