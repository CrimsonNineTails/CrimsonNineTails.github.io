        <p id="main2Info">This project is a research project on NSA and its security leaks. I think this project was extremely interesting but also difficult. The Snowden leak was one of the world's largest security leaks (CitizenFour, Weinstein Company). This was a real eye opener, learning that virtually everything we do online is being monitored and consequently that we have very limited privacy once we go online. While I feel that the NSAâ€™s activities are very questionable from a legal and constitutional aspect, I also feel that they are necessary. In other words, a major challenge of this project was that it presented me with a true dilemma. On one hand I believe in the importance of privacy as granted by the constitution, and on the other I understand that some type of surveillance is required to ensure national security. The fact that I had to find a reasonable solution to such a controversial problem was rather challenging. Additionally I found it very difficult to come up with a practical way to implement a solution that offers a balanced compromised, namely oversight by an independent organization.</p>
